This project demonstrates the autonomous takeoff and landing of a UAV on a moving platform, performed using the IRIS drone model available with Gazebo and Ardupilot. 
The stack for this project is:
1) Gazebo Harmonic sim
2) Ardupilot SITL
3) MAVSDK Python
4) RVIZ
5) Opencv

Successfully demonstrated the landing of a Quadrotor drone on a moving rover using Camera, IMU and altimeter sensor fusion and an aruco marker for detection.

NOTE: PROJECT FILES ARE NOT UPLOADED BECAUSE THIS IS A COLLEGE CAPSTONE PROJECT WITH NOVEL WORK THAT WILL SOON BE PUBLISHED.
